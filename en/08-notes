Now may be a good place to talk about function vs global variables, briefly. Function variables
should only be usable within the function in which it was defined. In order for code to be reusable
, functions should be atomic; there should be an ability to opperate on its own. 

So in the spirit of atomany we see the first instence in the keyword "local"; we only want these 
variables to be accessable from inside the function. Without this keyword we could access and 
possibly change the values of these variables making errors harder to find.

In shell scripting when we see "$" we assume that this is varriables, yet the numbers may be odd.
When scripting we reference parameters by position not name, so $1 means the first parameter passed.
Counting placements of parameters start at 1 not 0.
