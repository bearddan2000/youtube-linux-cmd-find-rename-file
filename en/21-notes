while getopts ":ud" opts; do
    ...
done

Getting back to SOLID principles we can define flages for the scripting file itself. If
one is familar with programming "while" is considered a flow controled operator; the rest of us
will understand that it repeats unless a condition is met. The condition(s) for the "while" is 
either "u" or "d". getopts stands for "get options" presumably from the file call and assigns
to a variable "opts".
