find . -type f -name "*${old}" -execdir sh -c \
    'x={}; mv $x $(echo $x | sed 's/${old}/${new}/g')'

echo is simply printing out the value held by x.
From the results of this command, we pipe the string to the sed command.
    
In linux scripting sed is usually used with files, but in reality sed can be used with either files 
or strings. With the results from the first command we can manipulate the string.
This sed command is substituting all occurances of java to groovy. A few points here, sed uses the 
afore mentioned regular expression between '/' so if you need a string pattern instead
of a single string, make sure to escape regex special characters. Another point, be careful with 
string that contains '/', these too need to be escaped.
