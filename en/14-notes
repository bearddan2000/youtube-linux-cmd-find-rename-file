find . -type f -name "*${old}" -execdir sh -c

Execdir is not only a flag but also a command in its own right. That said, sh -c are arguments for 
-execdir telling it which shell to execute. Ironicaly sh is the borne shell whereas the script is 
told to use bash: #!/usr/bin/env bash. 
How is this possible?

1. Borne is installed in most Linux distributions, yet bash is primarily for debian only. Not all 
Linux system are the same, this topic of distributions and shells are beyond the scope of this video.

2. mv, echo, and sed commands are included in both borne and bash shells. Either shell can read and 
execute these commands.

The -c is a shell flag borne\bash to tell it to execute the following string as if they were typed.
