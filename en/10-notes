find .

After the find program we see arguments that are passed to the program. Arguments or sometimes 
called flags, are used in programming to provide guidence to programs to execute certain features.

Here our first argument is a period which, in this context, means start are search in the current 
directory or folder if you prefer. This period can be changed to point at any directory, 
a tip would be always use full or absolute paths. 
For the find command it really doesn't care if you use absolute or relative paths but if you are 
using a large script file its just more readible.
