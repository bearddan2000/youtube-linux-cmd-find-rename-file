function rename()

To create a reusable command or piece of code we create functions, the following is how a 
scripting function is written. In shell scripting, functions operate differently than programming 
normaly. A function, as the name suggests, returns a value. However in scripting, functions act 
more like subroutines in that they really don't return anything.

Other differences can be seen in how values are passed to the function. In programming, we tend to
list parameters near the function name, but we will soon see that parameters are implicit instead
of explicit.
