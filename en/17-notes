find . -type f -name "*${old}" -execdir sh -c \
    'x={}; mv $x'
    
We use the captured results as a variable in the mv command. The mv command in Linux has two uses; 
first to actually move the file pointer from one directory to another and second to rename 
file/directory which is what we are doing here.
Yet this is only half of the command we still need a name to rename this file.
